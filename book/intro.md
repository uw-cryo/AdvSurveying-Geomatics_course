## Course Description
Covers modern surveying techniques that can be used for a range of engineering and scientific applications, with focus on precision mapping and 3D model generation using survey-grade GNSS receivers, drone-based Structure from Motion (SfM), and laser scanning (lidar). Weekly labs involve hands-on survey design, data collection, and data processing. Student groups propose and perform surveys as a final project.

## Course Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
* Prioritize and select the most appropriate surveying technique(s) for a range of applications, based on an understanding of methods and underlying physical principles.
* Design and execute new surveys to meet predetermined constraints (e.g., resolution, accuracy, coverage) and site conditions.
* Process, analyze, and interpret quantitative survey results, and communicate through reports and presentations.
